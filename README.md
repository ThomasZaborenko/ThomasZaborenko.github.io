## Projects
### Momentum Trading System

I developed a trading system that uses technical indicators (RSI, Bollinger Bands, MACD) and risk management strategies to find buy and sell opportunities in stock prices. The system uses Python and libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Plotly for data analysis and visualization.

#### Features
- **Automated Optimization**: Uses Bayesian optimization to tune parameters like stop-loss and take-profit levels for better performance.
- **Risk Management**: Includes trailing stop-loss, maximum drawdown tracking, and win-rate calculations.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluates strategies using Sharpe Ratio, cumulative returns, and trade duration.

#### Visualizations
- **Price Chart with Buy/Sell Signals**:
  - Visualizes trading signals on stock price data.
- **Optimization Progress**:
  - Convergence plots and parameter evaluations show the optimization process.

#### Tools and Libraries Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Plotly)
- Scikit-Optimize (for Bayesian Optimization)
- Matplotlib (for additional plots)

This project helped me learn about trading algorithms, quantitative analysis, and Python-based financial modeling.
